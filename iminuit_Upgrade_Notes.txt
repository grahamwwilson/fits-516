Hopefully there is some way to simply specify all the parameter values like the previous *m.values.values()
rather than having to list all of them (and know how many of them there are).

The iminuit2 changes are as follows.
1. The fixed, print_level and errordef quantities are no longer in the constructors.
2. The pedantic option has also been removed.
3. Use covariance rather than matrix
4. values "now behaves like an array instead of like a dict". So use *m.values instead of *m.values.values()

<       m.fixed["g"] = True

<       m.errordef = 1.0

Was a bit of a pain, but the new version does seem cleaner.
